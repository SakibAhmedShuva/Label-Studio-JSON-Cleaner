# Label Studio JSON Cleaner

A robust Python utility to clean and fix encoding issues in Label Studio JSON annotation files while preserving annotation structure and positions.

## Problem Statement

When working with Label Studio annotations, special characters and encoding issues can cause several problems:
- Model training failures due to malformed characters
- Shifted annotation positions during data conversion
- Processing errors in downstream tasks
- Reduced annotation efficiency and data quality

This tool addresses these challenges by carefully cleaning the JSON data while maintaining the integrity of annotation positions and structure.

Sample JSON file provided in "samples" folder.

## Features

- üîç Fixes common encoding issues (UTF-8 special characters)
- üéØ Preserves annotation positions and structure
- üõ°Ô∏è Maintains JSON data integrity
- üìù Supports nested JSON structures
- üîÑ Handles common problematic character sequences

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SakibAhmedShuva/Label-Studio-JSON-Cleaner.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Label-Studio-JSON-Cleaner
```

## Usage

```python
from ls_json_cleaner import clean_json_with_annotations

# Clean your Label Studio JSON file
input_file = "path/to/your/labelstudio_export.json"
output_file = "cleaned_annotations.json"
clean_json_with_annotations(input_file, output_file)
```

## Character Mappings

The cleaner handles the following common problematic character sequences:

```python
encoding_fixes = {
    '√É∆í√Ç': 'A',
    '√É': 'A',
    '∆í√Ç': '',
    '√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢': "'",  # Smart quote
    '√¢‚Ç¨≈ì': '"',  # Left double quote
    '√¢‚Ç¨': '"',   # Right double quote
    '√É¬©': 'e',
    '√É¬®': 'e',
    '√Ç': ' '
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Model Training**: Clean data leads to better model performance
2. **Maintained Accuracy**: Preserves annotation positions for accurate model training
3. **Error Prevention**: Reduces processing errors in downstream tasks
4. **Enhanced Efficiency**: Saves time by automatically fixing common encoding issues
